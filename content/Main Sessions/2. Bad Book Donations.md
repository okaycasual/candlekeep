You went to [[The Hearth]] and met the barkeep known as [[Konzo Bamus]] and an Ogre sitting next to the bar called [[Little One]].

After some time [[Amos Riven]], [[Teles Ahvoste]] and [[Tragorican]] arrived and everyone went upstairs into a magical meeting room.

[[Amos Riven]] said he heard rumours of strange shadows being seen on the edge of [[The Cloak Wood]].

[[Tragorican]] said he did not realise his spell would have the effect it had and was instead hoping to subdue the [[Shadow]].

When questioned on why he would be targeted he mentioned some fragments of mage journals he acquired in [[Baldur's Gate]]. 

The journals appear to talk about disguising ooze in the form of books and other objects, [[Amos Riven]] suggested you talk to [[Serasriel]] about newly acquired books.

[[Serasriel]] checked the gate logbook and said that there were three books that came in together:
1. [[The Sticky Black Book]]
2. [[The Dusty Book]]
3. [[The Shifting Book]]

 She says they were acquired from the [[The Bibliophile]] according to the scholar that donated them and were probably still to be processed in the [[Pillars of Pedagogy]].

You then went to investigate the books and found [[The Shifting Book]] behind the cage of magical books. Once acquired you discovered that the book was in fact a telepathic creature known as a [[Gingwatzim]].

The book convinced you to take it to [[Amos Riven]] where it attacked, but was subdued by being thrown into a [[Bag of Holding]].
