Some of you woke and were lured by a [[Siren's Music Box]] to a large treehouse. The rest of you followed. The tree was of a different kind to others in the woods.

Once there you discovered that three [[Green Hag]] named Etta, Gretta & Heretta. They attempted to put you to sleep so that they could extract your dreams and create [[Dream Cupcake]]. You found that two satyr had already been lured here [[Kemos]] and his friend.

After defeating two of the hags the one named [[Etta]] escaped.

 You searched the treehouse and found the [[Ring of Sweet Delight]], [[Hag's Toad Tea Pot]],  [[Staff of Crones]], and a recipe book on how to make [[Dream Cupcake]].

You also found a traveller's backpack containing a book called [[The Whisper of the Void]].

After showing [[Kemos]] and friend, to safety he presented you with [[Kemos's Whistle]] should you need to call on him within [[The Cloak Wood]].
