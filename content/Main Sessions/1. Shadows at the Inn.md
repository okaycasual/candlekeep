After a long day on the road you arrived at the [[Friendly Arm]].

You meet [[Shelly Mirrorshade]] the barkeep, and [[Tragorican]] a Great Reader of Candlekeep.

The Inn was then attack by mysterious shadow magic, transforming three patrons onto aggressive shadow creatures.

The attack also brought forth a creature known as a [[Shadow]].

Upon arriving at Candlekeep you met the Gatewarden and Great Reader [[Serasriel]].
Who would normally require a book as entrance fee, but due to the urgency and presence of [[Tragorican]] you were allowed entrance.

You were then greeted by a young avowed monk called [[Sprig]] who led you to the First Reader [[Amos Riven]].

The first reader seemed deeply concerned and arranged to meet later that evening at [[The Hearth]] to discuss the events of the [[Friendly Arm]].
