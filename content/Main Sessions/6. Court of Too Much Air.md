Before leaving [[Baldur's Gate]] you went to the large upmarket magic shop known as [[Sorcerous Sundries]].

You meant the friendly curator [[Tolna]] and the mage [[Lorroakan]].

[[Lorroakan]] told you that the [[Secrets of Candlekeep]] uses some kind of location magic.

The magical items in the shop were very expensive. One of you stole a magical stone.

When you returned to Candlekeep you encountered a large dust storm in the [[Court of Air]] full of [[Dust Mephit]] with a large [[Air Elemental]] at the centre.

You believe this was caused by [[The Dusty Book]] which you managed to close.
