Alaundo the Seer, also known as Alaundo the Wise, was a sage and prophet based at Candlekeep in the late 2nd century DR. He was the singular sage whose predictions actually came true through the ages.

Many now study his prophesies. [[Skoss Valanaster]] along with devout monks chant them most days in the [[Court of Air]].
