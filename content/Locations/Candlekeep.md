Candlekeep was the famous library-fortress that stood proud as a bastion of enlightenment and knowledge on the Sword Coast for many centuries. It housed a magnificent collection of books and scrolls of lore, considered the greatest collection of the writings in all of [[Faer√ªn]]. The keep was the home of [[The Avowed]], a group of renowned scholars and people of learning, that revered great seer [[Alaundo]] and his collection of prophecies that foresaw many great events that passed throughout the ongoing history of the Realms.

The keep can be divided into the [[Court of Air]] and the [[Great Library]].  With only [[The Avowed]] and those the full they fully trust being allowed entrance to the [[Great Library]].
