.One must choose which devil they deal with using utmost vigilance. Remember, devils are not only fiends - they're bastards. I once knew a man who asked for ultimate protection against his enemies from a devil of Dispater. He was transported into an impregnable iron fortress deep underground: one without doors. So, pick and choose with caution, friends.

For matters of money: creatures of Minarous can best salve your woes.

For matters of pleasure (or pain): face the fiery folk of Phlegethos.
