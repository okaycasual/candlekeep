Tiamat is a unique chromatic dragon, who had one head for each primary colour of the most common species of chromatics (black, blue, green, red, white). Each head is able to operate entirely independently of each other and has the powers of a member of the respective race of dragonkind. Her body also has traits in common with a wyvern, including a long tail tipped with a venomous stinger...

....When the gods of the Outer Planes came to invade the world, Tiamat resisted and opposed them even after [[Bahamut]] was defeated. She was eventually defeated by the combined might of the gods and sealed away in "a prison of darkness".

According to myth Tiamat was cursed after she slew a god of giants. Tiamat was doomed to become a prisoner in [[Avernus]], only able to leave the plane if summoned by a powerful ritual.
