The written language the Netherese used was a Draconic script known as Iokharic. Whereas the spoken language was Netherese, now considered a dead language but perhaps still spoken by the shades and [[Shadovar]] of the Anauroch desert...

...After the Netherese returned from the [[Shadowfell]], some spoke the 'Shadar-Kai' language who's written form looked similar to the elven 'espruar' script, though less fluid and more angular.

*The book then details some pronunciation differences between shadar-kai and elvish. It would be possible that someone who knowns elvish could pronounce shadar-kai out loud with this guide.*
